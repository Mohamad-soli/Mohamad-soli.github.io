### Hi, I'm Mohammad üëã

***‚ÄúIt is possible for ordinary people to choose to be extraordinary.‚Äù*** *(Elon Musk)*

There‚Äôs nothing more rewarding to me than completing my work with a dash of creativity. As a graduate mechanical engineer with a passion for the intersection of biomedical science and engineering, I've had the opportunity to engage in some fascinating projects. These include the separation of CTCs from blood using microfluidic chips, the development and manufacturing of Iran's first multi-channel real-time PCR system, and collaboration on fabricating bi-layered vascular grafts. These experiences have deepened my understanding of the field, and if you scroll down, you'll find some of the exciting projects I've been involved in!
